### In this Python project, I did the following:

- I did basic accounting with Python
- First of all I created a database with sqlite3
- Then I created a table with the following columns: name, surname, debt
- I created a function to add a new person to the table
- I created a function to delete a person from the table
- I created a function to update a person's debt
- I created a function to show all the people in the table
